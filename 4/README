For the sphere tessellation, if the primary subdivision is incremented beyond 5, the primary subdivision must be decremented (by pressing '-') until it is below 5 to see the tessellation changes.

This is relevant when switching between shapes, as a value larger than 5 for the primary subdivision may be used with other shapes-- which may make the sphere tesselation controls appear broken, but in fact it is not.
